This implementation is a **Tic Tac Toe game** with a user-friendly interface. The HTML structure includes input fields for players to enter their names, a game board with clickable cells, a scoreboard to track wins, and buttons to start and restart the game. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, where players take turns to mark cells as either "X" or "O". It checks for winning combinations or a draw after each turn, displays appropriate messages, and highlights the winning cells if applicable. Player names are dynamically fetched, and scores are updated after each round. The CSS adds an appealing style, with a background image, responsive board layout, hover effects, and animations for winning cells. The game is visually appealing and interactive, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
